You have undoubtedly heard the term “interest rate” a million times, but what does it mean as far as your pocketbook goes?

Interest is money you pay for the privilege of borrowing. Let’s say a bank loans you $1,000 at a 6% annual interest rate. That means you pay an extra $60 if you pay back the $1,000 at the end of 12 months.

That’s called “simple interest.”

Most loans, though, use “compound interest,” where you don’t just pay interest on the initial $1,000, you also pay interest on the accumulated interest. The rate that debt grows depends on how often the loan compounds, or comes due. With credit cards, it’s typically once a month. And it can add up if you’re only making minimum payments, or small payments.
